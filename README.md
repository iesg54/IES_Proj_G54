## HOW TO RUN SMARTHOME LOCALLY

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 
2. Run, in the root of the project:

```
docker compose up
```

3. After all the containers have started up, and are running, open the project in the following URL:
    - http://localhost:3000
    
4. In order to test all the functionalities of the app, log into an already existing account with historical data associated with it in the database:
    - Email: alberto.matias000@gmail.com
    - Pass: admin
Or just register a new account.
    
## HOW TO RUN SMARTHOME IN THE VIRTUAL MACHINE

1. Access the project folder

```
cd proj/IES_Proj_G54
```

2. Run the containers:

```
docker compose up
```

3. After the containers have started, we can open the project outside the virtual machine, using the URL:
    - http://192.168.160.238:3000/


4. In order to test all the functionalities of the app, log into an already existing account with historical data associated with it in the database:
    - Email: alberto.matias000@gmail.com
    - Pass: admin
Or just register a new account.

NOTE: The version available on the VM is located in the VM_Branch of this repository. The only difference to the version in the main branch is the use of different addresses for contacting the API in the frontend's files (as the VM machine has it's own IP)
